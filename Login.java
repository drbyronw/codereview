/*
Login.java: 
Discuss each code fragment (primary function(s) provided):

What are the inputs:
The only input is the username.

How is it processed:
The username is used to create a ChatClient with itâ€™s loginName being the username.

What are the outputs:
There is no output for any of the functions or for the whole file.

Who / What initializes the code:
A user running chatt-app will initialize this file first after the server has been set up because it is the GUI.

What are the major functions:
enter.addActionListener
If the login button is pressed, a new ChatClient is created and the login button is removed.
loginName.addKeyListener

If the enter button is pressed on the keyboard when in the text field, a new ChatClient is created and the login button is removed.

What objects are created / used:
The only object used is the ChatClient object.

What is the main purpose/job of the file:
The file is a GUI for Ghatt-app



Overall quality assessment
everything works but the majority of the running code is in the constructor in ChatClient.java.
There are several issues with style. There needs to be better error checking. There needs to be more comments.

Provide a quality grade / score (that can be compared to other fragments)
